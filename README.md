# Overview
This Repository contains the code of the master thesis of Philipp HÃ¶fling, written at the University of Bamberg, with the title "Development of an AI-based algorithm for the classification of gastric tissue in computational pathology".
This repository features prototype training pipelines, specifically designed for ResNet18 models, focusing on gastric mucosa classification.
The illustrated WSI test pipeline, developed in this work, enables trained ResNet18 models to classify whole slide images (WSIs), providing preliminary diagnoses and tissue heatmaps.

The dataset and the final models are hosted at the the [Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg's chair of Explainable Machine Learning](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/xai/).
# Data
The datasets located at the university chair's file server. Please contact the university chair for access to the datasets and the project files.

# Usage

To begin working with this project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhilippHoefling/WSI-Gastric-Tissue-Classification.git
```
Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd WSI-Gastric-Tissue-Classification
```

All methods and pipelines are accessed via [main.py](src/main.py). Ensure to replace all variables related to datasets, models and annotations according to your specific setup. 
The hyperparameters and class names for testing are controled via [config.py](src/config.py).
